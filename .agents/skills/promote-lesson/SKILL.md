description: Promote a repeated agent/session pitfall into reviewed repository metacode (AGENTS.md, skills, or docs/ai). Use at end of a task when the same mistake would recur, or when a high-cost misjudgment was discovered.

# Promote a lesson from session memory into the repo

## When to promote
Promote if any of these hold:
- The same pitfall appeared in a second session or PR.
- Cost is high (false-green build, production tunables, protocol boundary, dependency stripped by stash).
- Corrective action needs a non-obvious command or ordered checklist.

Do **not** promote one-off environment noise (transient port conflict, flaky network).

## What to write
Every promoted entry needs: symptom (what will be misread), root cause, correct action, verification command, scope. Vague advice ("be careful with migrations") is insufficient.

## Where it lands
| Kind of knowledge | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| Standing constraint for all agents | Thin rule in root `AGENTS.md`「始终生效」+ detail in `docs/ai/agents/*.md` (or nested package `AGENTS.md`); link to a skill for procedures |
| Repeatable procedure / checklist | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (canonical); mirror identical file under `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Tool- or VM-specific notes | `docs/ai/cursor.md` / `docs/ai/claude.md` (thin; point at skill when procedural) |
| Long-lived architecture decision | `docs/architecture.md` or ADR under existing docs layout |
| Still exploratory | `docs/dev/`, delete or fold into changelog when landed |

Vendor files stay thin compatibility bridges. Do not invent parallel roots (`CLAUDE.md` full forks of `AGENTS.md`, etc.). Do not commit `.cursor/plans/` or other local IDE state.

## Procedure
1. State the lesson in one paragraph with symptom → action → verify.
2. Choose destination from the table; prefer a skill if it is a multi-step procedure.
3. If writing a skill: edit `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, then copy the same content to `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
4. If `AGENTS.md` only needs a hard rule, add the rule plus a pointer to `.agents/skills/...` — do not paste the full checklist twice.
5. Remove or shorten duplicates in `docs/ai/*` so one path is canonical.
6. Human reviews before merge (`docs(ai): …` / `docs(agents): …`). Unreviewed local agent memory is not team truth.
7. When behavior changes later, update metacode in the same PR as the code change; delete stale entries instead of archiving piles.

## Verification
- `rg` shows a single canonical home (or a one-line pointer + skill body).
- A new agent can follow the text without the original chat.
- File names under `docs/` follow `docs/rules/documentation.md` (kebab-case, length limits).
